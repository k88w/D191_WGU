In this task, the data will be extracted and analyzed within the same database to reduce the technical challenges of manipulating multiple databases.

COMPETENCIES 4037.4.1 : Writing Complex SQL Statement

The graduate writes complex SQL statements in order to implement functions, stored procedures, and triggers to prepare data sets for data analysis and manipulation.

4037.4.2 : Configuring Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL) Workflows

The graduate configures data extraction, transformation, and loading tasks in order to automate data integration.

INTRODUCTION Data analysts frequently perform periodic extraction of data from a larger database. They then use this extracted data for analysis. A single data extract may serve different organizational needs such as populating an executive summary or providing a complete, detailed collection of data. This task will emulate such a process where you will create a repeatable data export, import, and analysis for various stakeholders.

In this task, the data will be extracted and analyzed within the same database to reduce the technical challenges of manipulating multiple databases.

This task defines a report as a collection of data that answers a real-world business question. The report contains two distinct sections that differ in the granularity of the data they present and how directly they support the answering of the business question of interest. The Detailed section will contain all data that informs the answers to the question, and the Summary section will include contains relevant aggregated data that provide the answer to the business question. For example, if the business question of interest in the context of a computer factory is focused on the number of the computers manufactured in the past six months, the detailed portion of a report could contain details on each individual computer made, while the summary portion contains only the total number of computers made in each factory.

Your business question must rely on the aggregation of data. In this task, the summary data will be automatically created from the detailed data.

REQUIREMENTS Your submission must be your original work. No more than a combined total of 30% of the submission and no more than a 10% match to any one individual source can be directly quoted or closely paraphrased from sources, even if cited correctly. The similarity report that is provided when you submit your task can be used as a guide.

You must use the rubric to direct the creation of your submission because it provides detailed criteria that will be used to evaluate your work. Each requirement below may be evaluated by more than one rubric aspect. The rubric aspect titles may contain hyperlinks to relevant portions of the course.

Tasks may not be submitted as cloud links, such as links to Google Docs, Google Slides, OneDrive, etc., unless specified in the task requirements. All other submissions must be file types that are uploaded and submitted as attachments (e.g., .docx, .pdf, .ppt).

To work on this task, please follow the link in the Web Links section below to the LoDs PostgreSQL lab environment. In this environment, you will be able to write and test your PostgreSQL code and access the databases to complete this task.

Your business question must rely on the aggregation of data. In this assessment, the summary data will be automatically created from the detailed data.

Plan for and compose the sections of a real-world business report that can be created from the DVD Database on Labs on Demand (see link below), and demonstrate the functionality of the supporting SQL code by doing the following:
